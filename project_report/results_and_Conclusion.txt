RESULTS
Real-Time Monitoring

The Zabbix dashboard successfully displayed live heart rate data from simulated IoT patient devices.
Five patient nodes (Patient-1 to Patient-5) were added to the monitoring system.
Each patient’s data (Heart Rate in bpm) was updated using the zabbix_sender command.

Example test commands:

zabbix_sender -z 172.24.113.11 -s "Patient-1" -k custom.heart.rate -o 76
zabbix_sender -z 172.24.113.11 -s "Patient-4" -k custom.heart.rate -o 135
Zabbix displayed updated values in the Latest Data and Graphs sections for each patient host.

Trigger and Alert Mechanism

Custom trigger logic was created to detect abnormal heart rate:
{Patient-X:custom.heart.rate.last()} > 120
When the threshold exceeded 120 bpm, the trigger activated and changed the patient status to Problem.
The alert was visibly shown on the Zabbix dashboard under “Monitoring → Problems”.
Alerts displayed color-coded severity levels (High for critical heart rate).

Visualization Dashboard

A custom Zabbix dashboard was created with the following widgets:
Top 5 Patients by Heart Rate
Graph of Heart Rate Variation
Patient Device Status
Dashboard auto-refreshed to show the most recent heart rate readings.

Telegram Notification

Telegram bot was successfully configured using BotFather.
A test message was sent using:
/usr/lib/zabbix/alertscripts/telegram.sh "<bot_token>" "<chat_id>" "Test message from Zabbix"
For demo purposes, dashboard alerts were used instead of direct Telegram notifications.

CONCLUSION

The Healthcare IoT Monitoring System was implemented successfully using Zabbix.
The project achieved the following objectives:
Real-time patient heart rate monitoring.
Automated alert generation for abnormal conditions.
Centralized dashboard visualization for hospital staff.
This solution showcases how IoT data and monitoring automation can improve healthcare efficiency, early detection, and patient safety.

Key Takeaways:

Zabbix can be effectively used as a healthcare IoT monitoring platform.
Triggers and alerts can detect critical patient conditions in real-time.
Future improvements:
Integrating temperature, oxygen, and ECG sensors.
Enabling cloud-based dashboard access.
Linking Telegram or email notifications for remote alerts.
